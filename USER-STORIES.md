# User Stories for NextGenOffice

This is a backlog of user stories for NextGenOffice.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in NextGenOffice, and which feature on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As an employee, I want each person in the virtual office to have a “status” icon that depicts their availability. For example, do not disturb, on a call, open to questions, etc. These customizable privacy settings would let me balance availability for collaboration with the need for focused work time without interruptions.
2. As a manager, I want the option to look at the workspace from a “birds-eye-view,” so that I can see what room each employee is in.
3. As a remote employee, I want the ability to customize my avatar’s clothes and facial features, so that the office environment can feel more personalized.

### Other Features

1. As an employee, I want a UI that lets me navigate between office rooms quickly, ideally by only pressing one or two buttons.
2. As a new hire, I want the ability to customize my virtual office space with personal items and decor, so that I can create a comfortable and motivating workspace that reflects my personality and work style.
3. As a remote employee, I want an interactive virtual break room with games and activities, so that I can socialize and unwind with colleagues during breaks, fostering team bonding and reducing feelings of isolation.
4. As an employee, I want to see which other people are in each room in the office before I choose to enter.
5. As a new hire, I want a designated “lunch” room so that on my lunch break I have the chance to meet and converse with my colleagues in a less “work-centered” environment.
6. As an employee, I want the login process every morning to be quick, and I want all of my information, such as office and avatar decor to be saved each time I log in.

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As an HR representative, I would like the application to provide me with detailed reporting and analytics on how each department uses each of the features of the app (break rooms, lunch rooms, solo rooms, etc) so that I can publish a well thought out best practices report for the company, and make informed decisions on how to improve department productivity and wellbeing
2. As an employee, I would like an optional icon to show up on my avatar when it is my birthday to let my colleagues know.
3. As an HR professional, I want the ability to host virtual career fairs and networking events within the platform, so that we can attract and engage potential candidates in an interactive and immersive environment.
4. As a project manager, I want a feature that enables real-time collaboration on documents and projects within the virtual workspace, so that team members can work together seamlessly and make decisions quickly, without the need for switching between multiple apps.
5. As an employee, I want my schedule to be integrated with the virtual envrioinment so that I can share my schedule with fellow employees and my manager if necessary and I can easily switch between the office layout and my schedule. 
6. As an employee, I would like to see when my manager is in a meeting vs available so that I know when I can check in or ask them questions
7. As an HR representative, I would like access to statistics on how much time each of my employees spends “interacting” with other employees so that I can schedule check-ins with employees that seem to be integrating to the work environment well, as well as those who might need some help. 
8. As an employee, I would like the virtual office to have decorations for major holidays, so that we can cultivate a joyful atmosphere even while working remotely.
