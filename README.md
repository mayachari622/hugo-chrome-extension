Project: This repo is for the hugo landing page for the Chrome Extension that Team 15 made in CIS 3500 at Upenn. It is a Hugo Landing page TabTracker which allows us to closely monitor our usage of different web pages, mark out tabs for closure and allow for easy navigation between tabs and windows.
